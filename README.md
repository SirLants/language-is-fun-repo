## Installing Bootswatch Theme

Go http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css , copy all. Then, after running "npm install", go into node_modules -> bootstrap -> dist -> css -> bootstrap.min.css, replace all the existing CSS with the bootswatch CSS. This is the custom theme that I chose. If you like something else you can literally just copy a different theme, replace that CSS, and we can play around with different themes. End result is the same, just some different styling.
