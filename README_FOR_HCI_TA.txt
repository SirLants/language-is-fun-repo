Dear TA,
I'm going to work over break and get the learning process completed.
I put a lot of work into this, hopefully missing those couple screens for now doesn't kill us. I need sleep.

What you get here is useless without node.js. Also, I hacked together a LOT of static margins
because I was still familiarizing myself with the fxFlexLayout framework. I've learned a lot. This
will look best and best represent the work I put into it on a 1920 * 1080 display of some kind.
Or a higher resolution monitor that you can zoom in on chrome with to achieve 1920 * 1080.

First you need to install node.js
Part of what comes with node.js is node package manager, npm. You need to install NPM at the PATH level,
there are root commands it runs for direct to file access and stuff. This will be automatically selected
when you install, so just don't uncheck things basically :D

Once node is installed, go to wherever you unzipped this in your command prompt and run "npm start".

Once you run npm start a server will boot up at localhost:4200.

When you go to localhost:4200 everything should work. The site is fully navigable. I tried to 
add tooltips to everything that doesn't work so that you don't get confused with what does and doesn't
work.


Enjoy! Make sure to check everything, there are some humorous little gems here and there.
